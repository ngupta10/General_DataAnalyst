            "He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).\n",
            "Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.\n",
            "Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk.\n",
            "\"Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago .\n",
            "I've asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you'd got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles —\" \"It wasn't me — and how did he know?\" \"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron.\n",
            "\"I told you, I didn't — but it'll take too long to explain now — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won't let me come back, and obviously I can't magic myself out, because the Ministry'll think that's the second spell I've done in three days, so —\" \n",
            "\"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he'd never meant any of it.\n",
            "Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, 'Mum, look who turned up in the night!' and she'll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\" \n",
            "\"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word.\n",
            "Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal.\n",
            "\"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.\n",
            "Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\n",
            "\"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\n",
            "When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don't they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench.\n",
            "\"I'll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny's hand and setting off.\n",
            "\"Let's go together, we've only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry.\n",
            "Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d'you think you're doing?\" \n",
            "For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys.\n",
            "Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\n",
            "\"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he'd just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn't we've come in the car, eh?\"  Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn't look happy at all.\n",
            "When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Mandrakes today.\n",
            "In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.\n",
            "\"Haven't even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.\n",
            "\"We'd better get him to Hagrid's, it's nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.\n",
            "\"No — honestly — didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?\" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\n",
            "\"Live 'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).\n",
            "\"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n",
            "Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle.\n",
            "\"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.\n",
            "\"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.\n",
            "Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don't know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione's door.\n",
            "Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \"D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\" \n"

            "\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry's reply, \"as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't want any — any funny stuff while she's here.\n",
            "Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (\"it's a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?\") or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (\"personally, I won't let any of the children out alone until he's back in Azkaban\").\n",
            "As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione.\n",

            "How's he going to get it with that thing around?\" \"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand.\n",
            "\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with all their shopping.\n",
            "Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.\n",
            "Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages.\n",
            "Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, Harry and Ron led the way to the end of the train, past packed compartments, to a carriage that looked quite empty.\n",
            "\"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?\" said Ron shakily.\n",
            "\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to hold Ron back.\n",
            "\"We must be nearly there,\" said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.\n",
            "\"Great,\" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside.\n",
            "\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, 'None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks.\n",
            "Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake.\n",
            "The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter!\n",
            "Ron  stared as Professor  McGonagall  ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.\n",
            "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.\n",
            "When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.\n",
            "\"What's up with you, Harry?\" \"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over at the Slytherin table.\n",
            "At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this subject.\n",
            "And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!\" Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.\n",
            "The Slytherins, still muttering about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\n",
            "\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though, wasn't it?\" said Ron, looking worried.\n",
            "\"Ar, maybe she's right,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs.\n",
            "Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.\n",
            "\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed.\n",
            "\"What's the matter, Lavender?\" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry, and Ron went to join the group.\n",
            "Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry and didn't talk to each other for the whole class.\n",
            "\"But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know, they're Muggles, they don't really understand about — about Hogwarts forms and stuff,\" Harry said, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods.\n",
            "\"Yeah, loads,\" said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.\n",
            "\"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't like.\n",
            "A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.\n",
            "\"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\" Harry said to Hermione.\n",
            "\"Harry, listen,\" said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, \"you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday.\n",
            "Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black.\n",
            "\"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table.\n",
            "\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.\n",
            "Yes, I know it's a map,\" he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed.\n",
            "\"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support.\n",

            "\"How's Ron?\" said Harry and Hermione together.\n",
